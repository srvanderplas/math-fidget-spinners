# Planetary Gear Fidget Spinners for Addition/Subtraction and Multiplication/Division

## Dependencies

To compile these with multicolor text, you will need https://github.com/jschobben/colorscad. I've written a bash script, `compile-to-3mf.sh`, which will create the openscad and 3mf files for each number. General settings (# gears, etc.) will need to be changed in the spinner.scad files.

The planetary gears used in these spinners are modified from the gears.scad library created by Dr. JÃ¶rg Janssen, version 2.2, which is CC-A-NC-SA. I've primarily added text to the gears in the right space.

By default, I've used Atkinson Hyperlegible font, which is supposed to be dyslexia-friendly, but also just seems to be fairly clear and easy to read.
